Writing Tests
#############

Introduction to the LAVA Test Developer Guide
*********************************************

This guide aims to enable users to be able to

#. Submit desired jobs/tests on targets deployed where the LAVA server is
   located and report results.

#. Understand how test job files need to be written so that jobs get submitted
   properly.

#. Understand how test shell definitions need to be written.

Ensure you have read through the introduction on :ref:`writing_tests`.

Pay particular attention to sections on:

* :ref:`writing_pipeline_submission`
* :ref:`writing_test_commands`
* :ref:`custom_scripts`
* :ref:`best_practices`

==============

* :ref:`dispatcher_actions`
* :ref:`lava_test_shell`

Assumptions at the start of this guide
======================================

#. The desired board is already configured for use with a LAVA Server instance.

#. A user account (username, password, email address) is already created by a
   LAVA administrator on your behalf, with permissions to submit jobs.

#. ``lava-tool`` is already installed on your test system and a
   suitable authentication token has been added.

#. You are familiar with submitting jobs written by someone else, including
   viewing the logs file for a job, viewing the definition used for that job
   and accessing the complete log.

.. If your desired board is not available in the LAVA instance you want to
   use, see :ref:`deploy_boards`.

To install ``lava-tool``, see :ref:`lava_tool`.

To authenticate ``lava-tool``, see :ref:`authentication_tokens`.

To find out more about submitting tests written by someone else, see
:ref:`submit_first_job`.

To find out more about viewing job details, see :ref:`job_submission`.

.. index:: availability

Checking device availability
****************************

Use the LAVA scheduler to view the device types and devices available
in your LAVA instance. The main scheduler status page shows data for
each :term:`device type` as well as the currently active jobs. Also
check the Devices pages:

* All Devices - includes retired devices to which jobs cannot be submitted.

* All Active Devices - lists only devices to which jobs can be submitted

* All Devices Health - limited to just the latest health status of each device.

* My Devices - available from your profile menu by clicking on your
  name once signed into the instance.

For a :ref:`MultiNode <writing_multinode>` job, you may need to check
more than one :term:`device type`.

LAVA looks at the :ref:`device status <device_status>` when working
out if a particular device is available for a new job:

* Idle, Reserved, Offline, Offlining - jobs can be submitted OK.

* Restricted - only specific users may submit jobs.

* Retired - this device is not available; jobs will be rejected if all
  devices of this type are retired.

Finding an image to run on the device
*************************************

Typically, the easiest thing to do here is to start with an image
which is already in use in LAVA. You can find one of these images by
checking the :term:`device type` in LAVA and viewing some of the jobs
for devices of this type from the table on that page. e.g. for QEMU
devices on validation.linaro.org:

https://validation.linaro.org/scheduler/device_type/qemu

Actions to be run for a LAVA test
*********************************

There are three important sets of actions that will normally be run
for a LAVA test:

#. **Deploy**: The actions needed to set up a device to boot a test
   image. Each device type may support a range of different deployment
   methods.

#. **Boot**: The steps to follow to start the test image on the
   device. Each device type may support a range of different boot
   methods.

#. **Test**: Run the lava test shell, running the specified tests.

Examples
********

Deploying a pre-built QEMU image
================================

.. code-block:: yaml

  actions:
    - deploy:
        timeout:
          minutes: 5
        to: tmpfs
        images:
            rootfs:
              image_arg: -drive format=raw,file={rootfs}
              url: https://images.validation.linaro.org/kvm/standard/stretch-2.img.gz
              compression: gz

.. index:: device tag example

.. _device_tags_example:

Using device tags
=================

A :term:`device tag` marks a specified device as having specific
hardware capabilities which other devices of the same :term:`device
type` may not. To test these capabilities, a test job can specify a
list of tags which the device **must** support. If no devices exist
which match all of the required tags, the job submission will fail. If
devices support a wider range of tags than required in the test job
(or the test job requires no tags), any of those devices can be used
for the test job.

.. note:: Test jobs which use :term:`device tag` support can **only**
   be submitted to instances which have those tags defined **and**
   assigned to the requested boards. In your LAVA instance, check the
   device information to see what tags are used.

When writing a normal single-node test job, the desired tags should be
listed as a top level list of strings in the job definition, i.e. at
the same level as ``job_name``, ``timeouts``, ``metadata`` and
``device_type``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Your first LAVA JOB definition for an x86_64 QEMU
    device_type: qemu
    job_name: QEMU pipeline, first job

    tags:
    - tap_device
    - virtual_io

    timeouts:
      job:
        minutes: 15
      action:
        minutes: 5
    priority: medium
    visibility: public

    # context allows specific values to be overridden or included
    context:
      # tell the qemu template which architecture is being tested
      # the template uses that to ensure that qemu-system-x86_64 is executed.
      arch: amd64

    metadata:
      # please change these fields when modifying this job for your own tests.
      docs-source: first-job
      docs-filename: qemu-pipeline-first-job.yaml

For :term:`MultiNode <multinode>` test jobs, the tags are defined as
part of the MultiNode protocol block:

.. code-block:: yaml

    protocols:
      lava-multinode:
        roles:
          client:
            device_type: qemu
            context:
              arch: amd64
            count: 1
            # In this example, only one role in the group uses tags
            tags:
            - tap_device
            - virtual_io
          server:
            device_type: qemu
            context:
              arch: amd64
            count: 1
        timeout:
          seconds: 60

Device tags are only relevant during scheduling of the test job and
have no meaning to the dispatcher once the job is running.

.. index:: checksum

.. _testjob_checksums:

Using checksums
===============

If an MD5 or SHA256 checksum is provided alongside the URL of the file to be
used in a test job, the downloaded content will be checked against the provided
checksum. The test job will fail as ``Incomplete`` if the checksum fails to
match.

Avoid using URLs which include shortcuts like ``latest`` when providing
the checksum. Specify the full URL to ensure consistency between tests.

.. seealso:: :ref:`make_tests_verbose`

Using LAVA Test Shell
=====================

The ``lava_test_shell`` action provides a way to employ a black-box
approach to testing on the target device. Its format is:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - test:
        failure_retry: 3
        name: kvm-basic-singlenode
        timeout:
          minutes: 5
        definitions:
            - repository:
                metadata:
                    format: Lava-Test Test Definition 1.0
                    name: smoke-tests-basic
                    description: "Basic system test command for Linaro Ubuntu images"
                run:
                    steps:
                        - printenv
              from: inline
              name: env-dut-inline
              path: inline/env-dut.yaml
            - repository: git://git.linaro.org/lava-team/lava-functional-tests.git
              from: git
              path: lava-test-shell/smoke-tests-basic.yaml
              name: smoke-tests
            - repository: https://git.linaro.org/lava-team/lava-functional-tests.git
              from: git
              path: lava-test-shell/single-node/singlenode03.yaml
              name: singlenode-advanced

The ``definitions`` list here may contain multiple test definition
URLs. These will all be run sequentially in one run on the test
device, and it will not be rebooted between the definitions.
